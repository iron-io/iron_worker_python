iron_worker_python is Python language binding for IronWorker.

IronWorker is a massively scalable background processing system.
[See How It Works](http://www.iron.io/products/worker/how).

# Getting Started


## Get credentials
To start using iron_worker_python, you need to sign up and get an OAuth token.

1. Go to http://iron.io/ and sign up.
2. Get an OAuth Token at http://hud.iron.io/tokens

## Install iron_worker_python

The recommended way to install iron_worker_python is through `pip` or `easy_install`. The package name is [iron-worker](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iron-worker):

```
$ easy_install iron-worker
```

For `pip`:

```
$ pip install iron-worker
```

If you don't want to use `pip` or `easy_install`, you can always install from source. First, you'll need [iron_core_python](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_core_python). Download that; the file you're after is named iron_core.py. Then, download the [iron_worker_python](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_python) library. The file you're after is named iron_worker.py. As long as both iron_core.py and iron_worker.py are in a directory in the import path, you're all set.

Including the library is easy:

```python
from iron_worker import *
```
## Configure

iron_worker_python follows the [standard configuration](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/configuration) convention followed by the other official libraries.

Create a file in the root of your project named "iron.json". You'll need your project ID and OAuth token. You can get them from [the HUD](https://hud.iron.io). Include them in the iron.json file as follows:

```
{
  "project_id": "Your_Project_ID",
  "token": "Your_OAuth_Token"
}
```

## Creating a Worker

Workers are just Python scripts that are run in the IronWorker cloud. Write them the way you would write any Python script.

Here's an example worker:

```python
print "Hello Python World!\n"
```

## Upload code to IronWorker

### Get the `iron_worker_ng` Gem

[Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) has a [command line interface](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/cli) to the IronWorker service that makes working with the service a lot easier and more convenient. It does, however, require you to have Ruby 1.9+ installed and to install the `iron_worker_ng` gem. Once Ruby 1.9+ is installed, you can just run the following command to get the gem:

```bash
$ gem install iron_worker_ng
```

### Create Your .worker File

.worker files are a simple way to define your worker and its dependencies. Save the following in a file called `HelloWorld.worker`:

```ruby
# set the runtime language; this should be "python" for Python workers
runtime "python"
# exec is the file that will be executed when you queue a task
exec "hello.py"
```

### Upload the Worker

Once you have your configuration file, your .worker file, and the gem in place, you can run `iron_worker upload HelloWorld` (if your .worker file is named HelloWorld.worker) to upload your worker.

## Queueing a Task

To run your code, you need to queue a task against it.

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = worker.queue(code_name="HelloWorld")
```

That will queue a task against the CodePackage with the name "HelloWorld". To pass a [payload](http://dev.iron.io/worker/payloads), just pass the data to `worker.queue`. It will be JSON-serialised and passed into your worker at runtime:

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = worker.queue(code_name="HelloWorld", payload={"fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"], "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"})
```

If you'd like to reuse Tasks or do more complex things with them, you can also instantiate them as instances of the `Task` class, then pass them to `worker.queue` method (this is actually what `worker.queue` is doing, transparently):

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorld")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
response = worker.queue(task)
```

If you'd like to, you can even set your task to run after a delay:

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorld")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
task.delay = 300 # start this task in 300 seconds (5 minutes)
response = worker.queue(task)
```

## Scheduling a Task

If you'd like to run a task at a specific time, or set a task to be run repeatedly, you want to create a [scheduled task](http://dev.iron.io/worker/scheduling). Unlike previous versions of iron_worker_python, we've unified tasks and scheduled tasks into the same interface. iron_worker_python will automatically detect when you want to create a scheduled task and react accordingly.

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorldRepeating")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
task.run_every = 300 # The task will run every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
response = worker.queue(task)
```

Likewise, if you'd like to run a task at a specific time, doing so is easy. Just pass a `datetime.datetime` object:

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloFuture")
task.start_at = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1) # start in an hour
response = worker.queue(task)
```

## Status of a Worker
To get the status of a worker, you can use the `worker.task` method.

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
details = worker.task(task)

print details.status # prints 'queued', 'complete', 'error' etc.
```

If you don't have an instance of `Task`, you can also pass in the task ID. Note that if you do this, however, and you are attempting to retrieve that status of a scheduled task, you need to declare that as well:

```python
task = worker.queue("HelloWorld")
details = worker.task(id=task.id)

print details.status

scheduled_task = worker.queue("HelloWorld", run_every=60, run_count=3) # run this task 3 times, once a minute
scheduled_details = worker.task(scheduled_task.id, scheduled=True)
print scheduled_details.status
```

## Get Worker Log

Use any function that prints text inside your worker to insert messages into you worker's log. To retrieve a worker's log, use the `worker.log` method.

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
time.sleep(10)
print worker.log(task)
```

If you don't have an instance of the `Task` object handy, you can also just use the ID of the task:

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
time.sleep(10)
print worker.log(id=task.id)
```

## Loading the Task Data Payload

When your code is executed, it will be passed three program arguments:

* **-id** - The task id.
* **-payload** - the filename containing the data payload for this particular task.
* **-d** - the user writable directory that can be used while running your job.

Simply open the filename passed by `-payload`, read its contents, and (if you used iron_worker_python to queue the task), decode the string as JSON:

```python
payload = None
payload_file = None
for i in range(len(sys.argv)):
    if sys.argv[i] == "-payload" and (i + 1) < len(sys.argv):
        payload_file = sys.argv[i+1]
        break

f = open(payload_file, "r")
contents = f.read()
f.close()

payload = json.loads(contents)
```
