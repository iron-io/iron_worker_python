iron_worker_python is Python language binding for IronWorker.

IronWorker is a massively scalable background processing system.
[See How It Works](http://www.iron.io/worker/how-it-works/).

# Getting Started


## Get credentials
To start using iron_worker_python, you need to sign up and get an OAuth token.

1. Go to http://iron.io/ and sign up.
2. Get an OAuth Token at http://hud.iron.io/tokens

## Install iron_worker_python

The recommended way to install iron_worker_python is through `pip` or `easy_install`. The package name is [iron-worker](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iron-worker):

```
$ easy_install iron-worker
```

For `pip`:

```
$ pip install iron-worker
```

If you don't want to use `pip` or `easy_install`, you can always install from source. First, you'll need [iron_core_python](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_core_python). Download that; the file you're after is named iron_core.py. Then, download the [iron_worker_python](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_python) library. The file you're after is named iron_worker.py. As long as both iron_core.py and iron_worker.py are in a directory in the import path, you're all set.

Including the library is easy:

```python
from iron_worker import *
```
## Configure

iron_worker_python follows the [standard configuration](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/configuration) convention followed by the other official libraries.

Create a file in the root of your project named "iron.json". You'll need your project ID and OAuth token. You can get them from [the HUD](https://hud.iron.io). Include them in the iron.json file as follows:

```
{
  "project_id": "Your_Project_ID",
  "token": "Your_OAuth_Token"
}
```

## Creating a Worker

Workers are just Python scripts that are run in the IronWorker cloud. Write them the way you would write any Python script.

Here's an example worker:

```python
print "Hello Python World!\n"
```

## Upload code to IronWorker

### Get the `iron_worker_ng` Gem

[Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) has a [command line interface](http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/cli) to the IronWorker service that makes working with the service a lot easier and more convenient. It does, however, require you to have Ruby 1.9+ installed and to install the `iron_worker_ng` gem. Once Ruby 1.9+ is installed, you can just run the following command to get the gem:

```bash
$ gem install iron_worker_ng
```

### Create Your .worker File

.worker files are a simple way to define your worker and its dependencies. Save the following in a file called `HelloWorld.worker`:

```ruby
# set the runtime language; this should be "python" for Python workers
runtime "python"
# exec is the file that will be executed when you queue a task
exec "hello.py"
```

### Upload the Worker

Once you have your configuration file, your .worker file, and the gem in place, you can run `iron_worker upload HelloWorld` (if your .worker file is named HelloWorld.worker) to upload your worker.

## Queueing a Task

To run your code, you need to queue a task against it.

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = worker.queue(code_name="HelloWorld")
```

That will queue a task against the CodePackage with the name "HelloWorld". To pass a [payload](http://dev.iron.io/worker/payloads), just pass the data to `worker.queue`. It will be JSON-serialised and passed into your worker at runtime:

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = worker.queue(code_name="HelloWorld", payload={"fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"], "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"})
```

If you'd like to reuse Tasks or do more complex things with them, you can also instantiate them as instances of the `Task` class, then pass them to `worker.queue` method (this is actually what `worker.queue` is doing, transparently):

```python
worker = IronWorker()
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorld")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
response = worker.queue(task)
```

If you'd like to, you can even set your task to run after a delay:

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorld")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
task.delay = 300 # start this task in 300 seconds (5 minutes)
response = worker.queue(task)
```

### Task Options

  - **priority**: Setting the priority of your job. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. The default is 0.
  - **timeout**: The maximum runtime of your task in seconds. The default maximum runtime is 3600 seconds (60 minutes), it can be up to 24 hours for Enterprise plans. The default is 3600 but can be set to a different duration.
  - **delay**: The number of seconds to delay before actually queuing the task. Default is 0.
  - **label**: Optional text label for your task.
  - **cluster**: cluster name ex: "high-mem" or "dedicated".  This is a premium feature for customers to have access to more powerful or custom built worker solutions. Dedicated worker clusters exist for users who want to reserve a set number of workers just for their queued tasks. If not set default is set to  "default" which is the public IronWorker cluster.


## Scheduling a Task

If you'd like to run a task at a specific time, or set a task to be run repeatedly, you want to create a [scheduled task](http://dev.iron.io/worker/scheduling). Unlike previous versions of iron_worker_python, we've unified tasks and scheduled tasks into the same interface. iron_worker_python will automatically detect when you want to create a scheduled task and react accordingly.

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloWorldRepeating")
task.payload = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"],
    "best_song_ever": "Call Me Maybe"
}
task.run_every = 300 # The task will run every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
task.scheduled = True
task.label = "custom_label"
response = worker.queue(task)
```

Likewise, if you'd like to run a task at a specific time, doing so is easy. Just pass a `datetime.datetime` object:

```python
task = Task(code_name="HelloFuture")
task.start_at = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1) # start in an hour
task.scheduled = True
response = worker.queue(task)
```

### Scheduling Options

  - **run_every**: The amount of time, in seconds, between runs. By default, the task will only run once. run_every will return a 400 error if it is set to less than 60.
  - **end_at**: The time tasks will stop being queued. Should be an instance `datetime.datetime`.
  - **run_times**: The number of times a task will run.
  - **priority**: Setting the priority of your job. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. The default is 0. Higher values means tasks spend less time in the queue once they come off the schedule.
  - **start_at**: The time the scheduled task should first be run. Should be an instance `datetime.datetime`.
  - **label**: Optional label for adding custom labels to scheduled tasks.
  - **cluster**: cluster name ex: "high-mem" or "dedicated".  This is a premium feature for customers to have access to more powerful or custom built worker solutions. Dedicated worker clusters exist for users who want to reserve a set number of workers just for their queued tasks. If not set default is set to  "default" which is the public IronWorker cluster.

## Setting Task Priority

You can specify priority of the task using `priority` field:

```python
task.priority = 0 # default value, lowest priority
task.priority = 1 # medium priority
task.priority = 2 # high priority
```

Value of priority field means the priority queue to run the task in. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. 0 is the default.

## Status of a Worker
To get the status of a worker, you can use the `worker.task` method.

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
details = worker.task(task)

print details.status # prints 'queued', 'complete', 'error' etc.
```

If you don't have an instance of `Task`, you can also pass in the task ID. Note that if you do this, however, and you are attempting to retrieve that status of a scheduled task, you need to declare that as well:

```python
task = worker.queue("HelloWorld")
details = worker.task(id=task.id)

print details.status

scheduled_task = worker.queue("HelloWorld", run_every=60, run_count=3) # run this task 3 times, once a minute
scheduled_details = worker.task(scheduled_task.id, scheduled=True)
print scheduled_details.status
```

## Get Worker Log

Use any function that prints text inside your worker to insert messages into you worker's log. To retrieve a worker's log, use the `worker.log` method.

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
time.sleep(10)
print worker.log(task)
```

If you don't have an instance of the `Task` object handy, you can also just use the ID of the task:

```python
task = worker.queue('HelloWorld')
time.sleep(10)
print worker.log(id=task.id)
```

## IronWorker Helper Functions

These functions will help you read in worker payloads and things for when your worker is running. To use these functions include the 'iron_worker' package in your .worker file and then use the helper functions:

```python
from iron_worker import *

print "Here is the payload: %s" % IronWorker.payload()
print "Here is the config: %s" % IronWorker.config()
print "Here is the tas id: %s" % IronWorker.task_id()
print "Here is the task dir: %s" % IronWorker.task_dir()
```

## Queueing a task from another task

If you need to run slave task from master task you should add two more lines to master worker file:

```ruby
# MasterTask.worker

runtime "python"
exec "master_task.py"

# install iron_worker on the server side
pip 'iron_worker'
remote
```

After it you can call your uploaded task from code:

```python
from iron_worker import *
worker = IronWorker(project_id=your_project_id, token=your_project_token)
task = worker.queue(code_name="SlaveTask")
```
